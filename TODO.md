add misc that i'm into board games and do board game design. 


intro for SPAR peops

I'm based in London :gb: and work at UK AISI where I lead engineering for Human-AI Interactions, such as building tools for expert red teaming and large‑scale user studies. My career so far has mostly been a wild mix of creative tech and public sector innovation.
My current goal is to tap more into conducting safety research myself, hence very excited to be joining SPAR and working with many of you this autumn!
If you're up for a coffee chat, feel free to DM me or grab a slot in my cal! Also happy to meet up if you're around in LND

Today, our new study on AI enabled persuasion, conducted in collaboration with Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was published in Science!

Across three experiments using 19 Large Language Models and more than 76,000 participants, we found that post-training techniques can boost persuasive power even more than model scale.

Participants held back-and-forth conversations with an LLM about one of 700 issue statements across the political spectrum, allowing us to measure how their agreement changed. We examined several drivers of persuasive capabilities in AI including model size, post-training methods and personalisation. 

Here are some of our key findings: 
📈Post-training matters more than model scale: smaller, open-source models can match or even exceed larger closed-source models when fine-tuning techniques are applied. 
📚Information density has a bigger impact that personalisation: prompting models to include as many verifiable facts as possible can boost persuasiveness by 27%.
⚠️More persuasiveness models make less accurate claims: the same factors that drive persuasiveness systematically decreased accuracy.

Alongside Anthropic and the The Alan Turing Institute, we’ve conducted the largest investigation of data poisoning to date.

Data poisoning occurs when individuals distribute online content designed to corrupt an AI model’s training data, potentially producing dangerous behaviours, including the insertion of backdoors – specific phrases that trigger an otherwise-hidden behaviour. Backdoors can be used to degrade system performance or even make models perform harmful actions like exfiltrating data.

We found that as little as 250 malicious documents can be used to “poison” a language model, even as model size and training data grow. Previous work had assumed that attackers would need to poison a certain percentage of data to succeed, but our results suggest that this is not the case. This means that poisoning attacks could be more feasible that previously believed.

We are releasing this content to raise awareness of these risks and spur others to take defensive action to protect their models. We’ll be continuing our work with Anthropic and other frontier developers to strengthen model safeguards as capabilities improve. 

Learn more on our blog: https://lnkd.in/egDzXC_g

🔎People are increasingly using chatbots to seek out new information, raising concerns about how they could misinform voters or distort public opinion.  

Our new study explores how AI is actually influencing real-world political beliefs. 
 
Our two key findings: 
1️⃣Chatbots are a popular source of political information: Based on a survey of almost 2,500 people, we estimate that 13% of eligible voters asked AI for information relevant to their electoral choice in the week before the 2024 UK election.  

2️⃣Belief in misinformation doesn’t seem to be increased by AI usage: In a randomised controlled trial of over 2,800 participants, we measured belief in true and false political claims before and after chatbot interactions versus standard internet search. We found that AI usage did not increase belief in misinformation any more than internet search – even when AI models were prompted to be more persuasive.  

Our research suggests that AI could be a useful tool for everyday information-seeking, without promoting misinformation to the extent that some have feared.

🔐 The more capable models become, the harder it is to safely evaluate them - but it’s essential that AI agents are tested. 

Sandboxes are isolated environments for testing and monitoring AI behaviour. 
 
Today, we’re releasing the Inspect Sandboxing Toolkit, tailor-made for secure and scalable agent evaluations. 

The toolkit extends Inspect, our open-source framework for AI evaluations, to enable the security, flexibility and scalability needed to evaluate advanced agents in diverse contexts.  
 
It contains detailed documentation to help you choose the right sandbox for your evaluation, alongside three core plugins to Inspect: 
 
1️⃣Docker compose: easy to implement for basic workflows  
2️⃣ Kubernetes plugin: scale to more containers and simulate complex environments  
3️⃣Proxmox plugin: strong virtual machine (VM) isolation for high-risk evaluations 
 
Our toolkit lets researchers safely test highly capable agents and offers a standardised framework for use across the AI evaluations community.
